## Introduction
Nocra is an innovative competitive learning platform designed to motivate students at university. 

Students compete for ranks and status. Although there is no material prize, the pure prestige of being the best amongst your classmates is worthwhile.

Read the website for more information.

## Key Features
- **Competitive Ranking System**: Students are ranked based on their performance in both academic grades and project submissions.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Grades**: Calculated using the formula (Relative Difficulty) * Current Grade. The difficulty is inversely proportional to the previous year's average grade for the course.
  - **Projects**: Evaluated through a dual review system comprising randomized anonymized peer reviews and an AI analysis using OpenAI GPT for instant feedback. Each review method contributes to a comprehensive rating to minimize bias.
- **Technology Stack**: Built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Deployed on Vercel.

## Local Development
